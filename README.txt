**MAKE SURE ALL THE FILES ARE IN ONE FOLDER**
Keep the README.txt, config.txt, etc files all in the same folder as the ig-bot.exe file. If not, there will be errors and you will be unable to run the program.

When you open up the program, the program will load for up to a minute (depending on the speed of your computer). During this time, the software is loading all the required data to work. The generated hashtags will appear in the "generated hashtags.txt" file. Click the pause button to pause ALL actions. Press the button again to resume all actions (this button is a toggle).

Needed files that have to be in the same file as ig-bot.py or ig-bot.exe for running the .exe file:
1. generated hashtags.txt (this is where your generated hashtags go)
2. config.txt (for bot settings)
3. README.txt (this file)
4. other.txt (for storing other information regarding the program)
5. ig-bot.py or ig-bot.exe (whichever one you purchased)
6. icon.ico


How to convert this ig-bot.py into an exe file:
Open up command and navigate to the folder holding the current .py file. Then do "pip install pyinstaller". Afterward, do "pyinstaller ig-bot.py --onefile". This step may take a few minutes depending on the speed of your computer. Afterward, there should be a bunch of new folders. If you navigate to the folder called "dist", you will find your ig-bot.exe file.

Needed if you want to run the raw .py file:
1. pip install InstagramAPI

*Note: depending on your OS and/or python version, you may have to do "pip3 install <module>" instead of just "pip install <module".
