3. config.txt (for bot settings)
4. README.txt (this file)
5. ig-bot.py or ig-bot.exe (whichever one you purchased)


How to convert this ig-bot.py into an exe file:
Open up command and navigate to the folder holding the current .py file. Then do "pip install pyinstaller". Afterward, do "pyinstaller ig-bot.py --onefile".
