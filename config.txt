When inputing the setting, do NOT delete the < and > arrows. Insert your text between the arrows. All action breaks (follow, comment, etc) are configured so whatever number you put as your <break>, that's how many minutes between each action. Reference the README file for which numbers correspond with which categories. Do NOT add '@' for your username.
